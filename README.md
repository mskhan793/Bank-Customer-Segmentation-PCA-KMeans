# Bank-Customer-Segmentation-PCA-KMeans
The goal of this project is to leverage AI/ ML model to segment customers for launching a specific targeted Ad-campaign. To make it successful, we have to segment them in at-least 3 distinct groups known as "marketing segmentation". It will help to maximize the marketing campaign conversion rate. For example the general four segments are:

1. Transactors: Customers who pay least amount of interest and very careful with the money. Generally they have lower balance(USD 104), cash advance (USD 303) and perecnt of full paymenet = 23%
2. Revolvers : (Most lucrative sector) use credit card as a loan, generally they have highest balance (USD 5000), cash advance (USD 5000), low purchase frequency, high cash 3. advance frequency (0.5), high cash advance transactions (16).
3. VIP/Prime : (This group is specific target to increase credit limit and spend habbit) High credit limit (USD 16K), high percentage of full payment.
4. Low Tenure: Low tenure (7 Years), low balance.

The steps performed in this task are:

1. Visualize and explore datasets
2. Scikit-Learn library to find the optimal number of clusters using elbow method
3. K-means using Scikit-Learn to perform customer segmentation
4. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique to perform dimensionality reduction and data visualization

The dataset could be accessed from Kaggle using following link:
